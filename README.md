# Golf Tournament API

Welcome to the **Golf Tournament API**, a RESTful API designed for managing golf tournaments and club members. This API allows you to perform basic CRUD operations on a MySQL database.

---

## Prerequisites

- **MySQL**: The database must be set up locally on your machine.
- **Docker**: Used to containerize and run the application.
- **Postman** (or any API client): To test the API endpoints.

---

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the API on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

### 2. Set Up MySQL Database
1. Open a terminal and start MySQL:
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p
   ```
2. Create the database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE golfclubdb;
   ```
   > Note: The required tables will be created automatically when the application is first run.

### 3. Build and Run the Docker Container
1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t server:latest .
   ```
2. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8080:8080 server:latest
   ```
